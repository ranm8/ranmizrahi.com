# About me

I'm Ran Mizrahi, founder and CEO of [Bit](https://bit.dev), helping the developer community and organizations alike to leverage modern components to make application development collaborative, efficient and fast.  
I'm passionate about the relationship between tech, product and business, helping these separate organisms to join and work collaboratively together and make the process of innovating more efficient for organizations and individuals alike.

I build open source, because I believe software development should be free and composable. Means you can pick and choose the pieces you want and throw these you don't.
