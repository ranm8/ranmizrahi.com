# Building a Micro Frontend architecture with Bit

What is a Micro Frontends? I think this is an open question that many are trying to answer these days.   
In my option, Micro Frontends is simply nomurous autonomous teams collaborating on one or more web applications. 


Bit is a component-based approach for building modern application.
