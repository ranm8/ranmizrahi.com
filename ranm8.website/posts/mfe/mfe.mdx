# Building a Micro Frontend architecture with Bit

What is a Micro Frontends? I think this is an open question that many are trying to answer these days.   
In my option, Micro Frontends is simply nomurous autonomous teams collaborating on one or more web applications. 

## Bit

Bit is a component-based approach to modern application development. Bit makes the development and composition of modern 
applications from independent components, owned by infinite autonomous product teams, collaborating together on dozes of 
application simple, repeatable and fun.

## Simple, decoupled codebases
In a micro-service architecture, teams get little and focused codebases which highly ease on-boarding of new developers
and developer productivity.
With Bit, each team can its own dynamic component codebase... which allows them to maintain and own only the components they
are respoinsible for.

- Dynamic workspaces, for a team, or individual.
- Access and change any component from your workspace.
- Reuse any component/API built by any other team. 

## Application development

## Component development

## Independent deployments
Every team can independetly release new versions to components, used across all in other applications. 

### Run-time dependencies

### Build-time dependencies

## Autonomous teams


## Cross team collaboration and integration

### Updates

### API Feedbacks

### CI/CD

## Data fetching



## Styling and themeing


## Testing
Each component is testing itself and its dependencies.

## Application performance


## Share components in any level of granularity.
Components can be shared in any level of granularity.
